### Hi there, we are Tropos.io ðŸ‘‹


We are a modern consulting firm focused on strategy and technology to support data driven business transformation. We design, build and operate data analytics platforms, products and projects to solve challenging business problems. We are 100% focused on using public cloud for our toolkit. Find us at [Tropos.io][website]


## Our partnerships.

As an innovative service provider, we are tool agnostic by nature. We rely on both open-source and SAAS to get the job done. Nonetheless, we maintain good relations with technology vendors of whom we think they offer quality services we can rely on:

- [Snowflake][snowflake]: We are the first Snowflake parter in Belgium (way before it became obvious), and one of the first 20 in Europe. We are profoundly experienced in designing, configuring and operating the Snowflake data cloud for clients ranging from SME to global corporations.
- [AWS][aws]: We are an Amazon Web Services partner, focused on data analytics projects.
- [Matillion][matillion]: An accessible data transformation product open to data- and business teams alike.
- [Datadog][datadog]: Our standard toolkit for platform monitoring.
